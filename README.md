# Blending-Physics
This repo contains some examples of using the open-source 3D animation software Blender, along with Python, to create visually-appealing, yet physically accurate animations of some simple physical systems. 

Creating good visualizations is an incredibly important job of scientists, as it is foundational to clearly explaining our work. However, the figures, videos, and animations which are used to demonstrate experiments and models are often nowhere near as effective as they could be. On the other end, some of these visual stories created for a lay audience lack technical accuracy in exchange for simplicity and visual appeal. .
